					The Indian subcontinent is huge and diverse, and it does not fail to cast a spell on anyone who travels through it. 
					Visitors to India are charmed, inspired and bemused by its diverse sights, sounds and smells â€“ it is a holiday destination unlike any other in the World. 
					The Indian subcontinent is perhaps the only destination in the World where in a two week holiday, you can do a high altitude trek, do a wildlife safari in a National Park, spend a night lazily cruising the backwaters, ride a Camel in the desert, spend time gazing at the Taj Mahal, and still have time to relax on a beach !!
